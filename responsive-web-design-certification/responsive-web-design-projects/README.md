# Responsive Web Design Projects

I forked the original projects for freeCodeCamp certification from the [freeCodeCamp Test Suite Template](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/MJjpwO) on [Codepen](https://codepen.io).

This repository only hosts a "no tests", Codepen-independent version of each project.
